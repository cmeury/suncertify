DB
--

- Reading and writing to the database file is real-time, since the assignment does not
  require the other custom application should be able to access the data while this
  application is running.
- A proxy was implemented (DataProxy) to hide the ugly and error-prone arrays used in the DB interface.

Searching

- The assignment states that the application "must allow the user to search all data"
  which I translate to: it must be possible to display all data (unfiltered).
  Furthermore, it states that it must offer the possibility to search "for records
  where the name and/or location field exactly match values specified by the user"
  which I have implemented with two text fields that offer live search. I interpreted
  "name and/or location" as allowing the user to search for either and not to offer "OR"
  as a search modifier. I further assume the user expectation of two search fields is an AND
  search mode.
